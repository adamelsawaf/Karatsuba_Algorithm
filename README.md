# Karatsuba_Algorithm
Implementation of the Karatsuba Algorithm, a fast multiplication algorithm which multiplies two very large n-digit non-negative integers in time T(n) ∈ O(n ^ lg(3)) ≈ O(n ^ 1.585). This program stores the given integers as strings, and so the program is able to calculate products containing up to overfour million digits.
